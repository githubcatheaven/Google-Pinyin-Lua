Google Pinyin Plugin: Relative Date and Month Calculation
This is a Google Pinyin input method plugin developed in 2012 with a unique feature: fully handwritten algorithms for calculating relative dates and months in Chinese text. The project was uploaded to GitHub in 2013.

Overview
Fully handwritten code: This plugin was entirely written by hand, without any AI assistance, completing in 2012.

Relative date and month calculations: Provides advanced Chinese input capabilities by interpreting relative date expressions (e.g., "next Monday," "last month") and converting them into exact calendar dates.

Standalone logic: No third-party libraries or external engines were used for the date calculations.

Legacy implementation: Represents a significant technical achievement in natural language date parsing within the Chinese input method ecosystem at that time.

Features
Convert Chinese relative day expressions into accurate Gregorian dates.

Calculate dates relative to the current day or month.

Robust handling of various date formats and contextual clues.

Usage
Suitable for integration with Google Pinyin or other compatible Chinese input methods.

Historical Significance
This was before the advent of AI assistance and state-of-the-art language models, showcasing pure algorithmic craftsmanship in date parsing and Chinese language tooling.
